# Rock Paper Scissors - Original

This is the first JavaScript project that's part of The Odin Project. The idea is to create a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user plays five rounds against the computer and the party that won the most number of rounds is the ultimate winner. Full details about this project can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

For this game, I was able to practice creating and using functions, `if/else` conditional statements, loops, and `return` statements. I used a `for` loop to run five consecutive rounds. Each round, the user inputs their choice while the computer randomly generates theirs, then the console prints the winner at the end. The winner's score is then incremented by 1 and the party with the highest score after five rounds is declared the winner.

# Rock Paper Scissors - Revisited

I revisited this game after learning more about DOM manipulation and events. The second part of this project was to make a UI for the game; more details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors). I made a simple UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and was able to learn more about how to use event listeners in the process.

One key difference in the updated version of this game is that the user plays against the computer until one party wins 5 consecutive rounds as opposed to only playing 5 rounds total. The user also plays the game using the UI rather than the console.
